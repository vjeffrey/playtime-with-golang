# game-time

### this game is based off the following <a href="https://gocodecloud.com/blog/2016/03/19/writing-a-text-adventure-game-in-go---part-1/">tutorial.</a>

## how it works

`main.go`
 - sets us up with input and output, including color formatting
 - initializes the player data and calls player.Play() -> in `characters.go`

`data.go` : data for the game
